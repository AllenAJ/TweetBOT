I am really happy that I got a chance to be here today
soooo happy !!
atleast got the chance to bunk all my classes
and get attendence too !!
let's see how fortunate my day is today
Kochi is really the best!!
but the competetion though ...
its really intense!!
i know!!
#kochiisthebest !!
im running out of ideas to tweet
come on
i would have been pretty happy if atleast one team from my school gets selected !!
need not be my team
although we are quite strong
staying strong!!
hoping to hit atleast 500 tweets today!!
will i make though??
i really dont know
its my contribution to break last years record
we will make it
i know we will
ugh i hate the autocorrect on my keyboard!!
but i do like it sometimes
like when automatically filling in the hastags!!
I hope I have been tweeting correctly. ..
or ...
all the tweets gone waste !!
i cant even think about it
not all my friends are here though!!
but still excited
newbies versus tcs veterans
the quiz is sure exciting
the handbook you gave sure is interesting!!
im opening it only now
i know its awesome
trying to be the best
what am i even tweeting??
im going crazyyyyy
man im renning out of ideas ...
fast
enjoying ...
i hope tcsitwiz is trending
of course it is
any good game you know of??
dm me 
im bored
slightly
gotta tweet em alll
how many tweets have i reached??
spelling mistakes be lake
even though we were late we didnt quite miss anything
gokulam convention centre is the best!!
i wonder what it is that makes tcsitwiz the best
is it picbrain??
or is it the talent that flows in??
or is it the tweetporting contest?
either way tcsitwiz is the best
east or west tcsitwiz is the best
why arent parents allowed in here
only teachers
olso why isnt there any option for registring individualy?
like not from schools??
any idea how many tweets i have reached?
any unbox therapy fans??
lew is awesome right???
man his job is so cool
testing out gadgets and getting paid for it!!
that is a job!
man this quiz makes you think out of the box
everytime...
its the reason people love it so much
picbrain is a reason too
he too is awesome...
what more could you ask out of a quiz master
everyone so engrossed in tweeting!!
everyone is so focused
and the prelims were a joy
who knew i knew so much
and my partner is awesome
battery getting low
anybody has a powerbank?
yes got one
gotta get atleast 500 tweets
but still not enough to win tweetporting
man the competetion for tweetporting is brutal
last time sme guy did a 1200 tweets 
its impossible for normal human beings
but still again trying this year
though there is no point in trying
but still..
no harm in trying
it really is the best
so happy right now
i simply dont know why
i think i crossed around 300 tweets!!!
or so i do hope
or so i really do hope
what else can i do but hope
hope is a powerful thing
im so thirsty where can i get some water?
got some
kudos to the voulunteers here they are doing a great job
the best quiz everrrr
